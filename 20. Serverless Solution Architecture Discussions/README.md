## Microservice architecture
- We want to switch to a microservice architecture
- Many services interact with each other directly using a REST API
- Each architecture for each microservice may vary in form and shape
- We want a microservice architecture so we can have a leaner development lifecycle for each service
- Free to design each microservice the way you want
- Synchronous patterns: API Gateway, Load Balancers
- Asynchronous patterns: SQS, Kinesis, SNS, Lambda triggers (S3)
- Challenges with microservices:
  - Repeated overhead for creating each new microservice
  - Issues with optimizing service density/utilization
  - Complexity of running multiple versions of multiple microservices simultaneously
  - proliferation of client-side code requirements to integrate with many separate services
- Some of the challenges are solved by Serverless patterns:
  - API Gateway, Lambda scale automatically and you pay per usage
  - You can easily clone API, reproduce environments
  - Generate client SDK through Swagger integration for the API Gateway
