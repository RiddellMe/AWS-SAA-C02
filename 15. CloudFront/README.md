# AWS CloudFront
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
- 216 Points of Presence globally (edge location)
- DDoS protection, integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall
- Can expose external HTTPS and can talk to internal HTTPS backends

### Origins
- S3 bucket
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge
  - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
- Custom Origin (HTTP)
  - Application Load Balancer
  - EC2 instance
  - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
  - Any HTTP backend you want

### CloudFront Geo Restriction
- You can restrict who can access your distribution
  - Whitelist: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries
  - Blacklist: Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries
- The 'country' is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database
- Use case: Copyright laws to control access to content

### CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
- CloudFront:
  - Global Edge Network
  - Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
  - Great for static content that must be available everywhere
- S3 Cross Region Replication:
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
  - Files are updated in near real-time
  - Read only
  - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

## CloudFront Signed URL/Signed Cookies
- You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
- We can use CloudFront Signed URL/Cookie. We attach a policy with:
  - Includes URL expiration
  - Includes IP ranges to access the data from
  - Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLs)
- How long should the URL be valid for?
  - Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes)
  - Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
- Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file)
- Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)

### CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL
- CloudFront Signed URL:
  - Allow access to a path, no matter the origin
  - Account wide key-pair, only the root can manage it
  - Can filter by IP, path, date, expiration
  - Can leverage caching features
- S3 Pre-Signed URL:
  - Issue a request as the person who pre-signed the URL
  - Uses the IAM key of the signing IAM principal
  - Limited lifetime

## CloudFront - Pricing
- CloudFront Edge locations are all around the world
- The cost of data out per edge location varies
- Price classes:
  - You can reduce the number of edge locations for **cost reduction**
  - Three price classes:
    1. Price Class All: all regions - best performance
    2. Price Class 200: most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
    3. Price Class 100: only the least expensive regions
- Multiple Origin
  - To route to different kind of origins based on the content type
  - Based on path pattern:
    - /images/*
    - /api/*
    - /*
- Origin Groups
  - To increase high-availability and do failover
  - Origin Group: one primary and one secondary origin
  - If the primary origin fails, the second one is used
- Field Level Encryption
  - Protect user sensitive information through application stack
  - Adds an additional layer of security alongside HTTPS
  - Sensitive information encrypted at the edge close to user
  - Use asymmetric encryption
  - Usage:
    - Specify set of fields in POST requests that you want to be encrypted (up to 10 fields)
    - Specify the public key to encrypt them

## Global users for our application
- You have deployed an application and have global users who want to access it directly
- They go over the public internet, which can add a lot of latency due to many hops
- We wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency
- Unicast IP vs Anycast IP
- Unicast IP: one server holds one IP address
- Anycast IP: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one

### AWS Global Accelerator
- Leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application
- The Anycast IP send traffic directly to Edge Locations
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application
- Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private
- Consistent performance
  - Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
  - No issue with client cache (because the IP doesn't change)
  - Internal AWS network
- Health Checks
  - Global Accelerator performs a health check of your applications
  - Helps make your application global (failover less than 1 minute for unhealthy)
  - Great for disaster recovery (thanks to health checks)
- Security
  - Only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted
  - DDoS protection thanks to AWS Shield

### AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- CloudFront
  - Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
  - Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
  - Content is served at the edge
- Global Accelerator
  - Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
  - Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
  - Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
  - Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
  - Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
