# AWS RDS Overview
- It's a managed DB service for DB that use SQL as a query language
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)
- Advantages:
  - RDS is a managed service:
    - Automated provisioning, OS patching
    - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)
    - Monitoring dashboards
    - Read replicas for improved read performance
    - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
    - Maintenance windows for upgrades
    - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
    - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
    - But you can't SSH into your instances
- RDS backups:
  - Automatically enabled in RDS
  - Automated backups:
    - Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
    - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
    - Ability to restore to any point in time (form oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
    - 7 day retention (can be increased to 35 days)
  - DB Snapshots:
    - Manually triggered by the user
    - Retention of backup for as long as you want
- Storage Auto Scaling:
  - Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
  - When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
  - Avoid manually scaling your database scaling
  - You have to set **Maximum Storage Threshold** (maximum limit for DB storage)
  - Automatically modify storage if:
    - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
    - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
    - 6 hours have passed since last modification
  - Useful for applications with **unpredictable workloads**
  - Supports all RDS database engines

##RDS Read Replicas vs Multi AZ
- Read Replicas for read scalability
  - Help scale **reads**
  - Up to 5 read replicas
  - Within AZ, Cross AZ, or Cross Region
  - Replication is **ASYNC**, so reads are eventually consistent
  - Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
  - Application must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
- Use cases:
  - You have a prod database that is taking on normal load
  - You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
  - You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
  - The production application is unaffected
  - Read replicas are used for SELECT only kind of statements
- Network Cost:
  - In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
  - **For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee**
  - Cross region does incur network costs
- Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery):
  - SYNC replication to a standby instance
  - One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
  - Increase **availability**
  - Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
  - No manual intervention in apps
  - Not used for scaling
  - Note: The read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)
- From single-AZ to multi-AZ:
  - Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
  - Just click on 'modify' for the database and enable Multi-AZ
  - The following happens internally:
    - A snapshot is taken of main DB
    - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
    - Sync is established between the 2 databases

## RDS Security - Encryption
- At rest encryption
  - Possibility to encrypt the master and read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
  - Encryption has to be defined at launch time
  - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
  - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server
- In-flight encryption
  - SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight
  - Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database
  - To **enforce** SSL:
    - PostgreSQL: rds.force_ssl=1 in the AWS RDS console (parameter groups)
    - MYSQL: Within the DB: GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
- Encryption operations:
  - Encrypting RDS backups:
    - Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted
    - Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted
    - Can copy an unencrypted snapshot into an encrypted one
  - To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database:
    - Create snapshot of the un-encrypted database
    - Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
    - Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
    - Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database
- Network and IAM:
  - Network Security
    - RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
    - RDS security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2 instances) - it controls which IP / security group can communicate with the RDS
  - Access Management:
    - IAM policies help control who can **manage** AWS RDS (through the RDS API)
    - Traditional username and password can be used to **login** to the database
    - IAM-based authentication can be used to login to RDS MySQL and PostgreSQL
  - IAM Authentication
    - IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL
    - You don't need a password, just an authentication token obtained through IAM and RDS API calls
    - Auth token has a lifetime of 15 minutes
    - Benefits:
      - Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL
      - IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB
      - Can leverage IAM Roles and EC2 Instance profiles for easy integration

## Amazon Aurora
- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
- Aurora is 'AWS cloud optimized' and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128TB
- Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process is faster (sub 10ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It's HA native.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient
- High Availability and Read Scaling
  - 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:
    - 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
    - 3 copies out of 6 needed for reads
    - Self healing with peer to peer replication
    - Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
    - One Aurora Instances takes writes (master)
    - Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
    - Master + up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas serve reads
    - Support for Cross Region Replication
- DB Cluster
  - Writer endpoint - points to the master
  - Replicas can be part of an **auto scaling group**
  - Reader endpoint - connection load balancing - connects automatically to all read replicas
  - Load balancing happens at the **connection level**, not the statement level
- Features of Aurora
  - Automatic failover
  - Backup and Recovery
  - Isolation and security
  - Industry compliance
  - Push-button scaling
  - Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
  - Advanced Monitoring
  - Routine Maintenance
  - Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups
- Aurora Security
  - Similar to RDS because uses the same engines
  - Encryption at rest using KMS
  - Automated backups, snapshots, and replicas are also encrypted
  - Encryption in flight using SSL (same process as MySQL or Postgres)
  - **Possibility to authenticate using IAM token (same method as RDS)**
  - You are responsible for protecting the instance with security groups
  - You can't SSH

### Aurora Serverless
- Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
- Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
- No capacity planning needed
- Pay per second, can be more cost-effective

### Aurora Multi-Master
- In case you want immediate failover for write node (HA)
- Every node does R/W - vs promoting a RR (read replica) as the new master

### Global Aurora
- Aurora cross region read replicas:
  - Useful for disaster recovery
  - Simple to put into place
- Aurora Global Database (recommended):
  - 1 Primary Region (read/write)
  - Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
  - Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region
  - Helps for decreasing latency
  - Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute

### Aurora Machine Learning
- Enables you to add ML-based predictions to your applications via SQL
- Simple, optimized, and secure integration between Aurora and AWS ML services
- Supported services:
  - Amazon SageMaker (use with any ML model)
  - Amazon Comprehend (for sentiment analysis)
- You don't need to have ML experience
- Use cases: fraud detection, ads targeting, sentiment analysis, product recommendations

## ElastiCache Overview
- The same way RDS is used to **manage** a set of Relational Databases m ElastiCache is used to manage Redis of Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance and low latency
- Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
- Helps make your application stateless
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance/patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery, and backups
- **Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes**
- Solution Architecture - DB Cache
  - Applications query ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache
  - Helps relieve load in RDS
  - Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there
- Solution Architecture - User Session Store
  - User logs into any of the applications instances
  - The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
  - The user hits another instance of our application
  - The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in
- Redis vs Memcached
  - Redis:
    - Multi AZ with Auto-Failover
    - Read replicas to scale reads and have high availability
    - Data Durability using AOF persistence
    - Backup and restore features
  - Memcached:
    - Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding)
    - No high availability (replication)
    - Non persistent
    - No backup and restore
    - Multi-threaded architecture

## ElastiCache - Cache Security
- All caches in ElastiCache:
  - **Do not support IAM Authentication**
  - IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis AUTH
  - You can set a 'password/token' when you create a Redis cluster
  - This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
  - Support SSL in flight encryption
- Memcached
  - Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)
- Patterns for ElastiCache:
  - Lazy loading: all the read data is cached, data can become stale in cache (only loaded when cache is queried first time)
  - Write through: Adds or updates data in the cache when written to a DB (no stale data)
  - Session store: Store temporary session data in a cache (using TTL features)
- Redis use case:
  - Gaming Leaderboards are computationally complex
  - **Redis Sorted sets** guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering
  - Each time a new element is added, it's ranked in real time, then added in the correct order
